My research focuses developing computational decision systems in two seemingly unrelated yet personally fascinating fields: medical sciences and quantitative trading.

In medical sciences, I am exploring how mathematical optimization can advance the diagnosis, treatment, and healthcare interventions for critical illnesses in neurology and immunology, including neuro-degenerative (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) and neuro-developmental disorders (e.g., Autism/Asperger's), immune disorders (e.g., autoimmune diseases), and vestibular disorders (e.g., Mal de Débarquement Syndrome, MdDS).

In quantitative trading, my goal is to design computational models that empower retail and individual traders to make more informed investment decisions. This contrasts with the traditional emphasis on supporting institutional traders.

Before transitioning to academia, I worked as a data scientist in industry, where I developed large-scale, production-level machine learning and mathematical optimization models to enhance operational efficiency across areas such as anti-fraud management, credit risk, and pricing. For example, at Capital One, I developed a novel integer-programming model to determine how quickly customers could access their funds after depositing a check. Over the years, I held various roles at organizations including Goldman Sachs, Capital One, Freddie Mac, AvalonBay, and Deloitte.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing and watching sports — particularly tennis, basketball, and soccer — as well as reading about history.
