## About Me <a id="about"></a>

I am pursuing a PhD in Operations Research/Decision Sciences at the George Washington University School of Business, supervised by Miguel Lejeune. In 2023 Fall, I spent a semester in the PhD program in Data Sciences and Operations (DSO) at Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California (USC) , before returning to D.C. for family reasons. 

My current research explores computational optimization and its applications in two seemingly unrelated yet personally fascinating fields: medical sciences and quantitative trading.

In medical sciences, I am exploring how mathematical optimization can enhance the understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and healthcare interventions for life-altering illness in neurology and immunology, including neuro-degenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), immune disorders (e.g., autoimmune diseases), and vestibular disorders (e.g., Mal de Débarquement Syndrome(MdDS)).

In quantitative trading, my goal is to design computational models that empower retail and individual traders to make more informed investment decisions. This contrasts with the traditional emphasis on supporting institutional traders.

Before transitioning to academia, I worked as a data scientist in industry, leading cross-functional projects to develop large-scale, production-ready machine learning and mathematical optimization models. These models were designed to improve operational efficiency in areas such as fraud prevention, customer experience, credit risk assessment, and pricing optimization. For instance, at Capital One, I developed a novel integer programming model to optimize fund availability following customer check deposits, while simultaneously mitigating the bank’s exposure to fraud risk. This solution significantly accelerates funds availability for millions of customers using Capital One’s mobile app,  providing faster access to their money. Over the years, I held various roles at Goldman Sachs, Capital One, Freddie Mac, AvalonBay, and Deloitte.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing and watching sports — particularly tennis, swimming, basketball — as well as reading about history.
