My research focuses on developing computational decision-support models in two seemingly unrelated yet personally fascinating fields: medical sciences and quantitative trading.

In medical sciences, I am exploring how mathematical optimization can advance the diagnosis, treatment, and healthcare interventions for critical illnesses in neurology and immunology, including neurodegenerative (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) and neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., Autism/Asperger's), immune disorders (e.g., autoimmune diseases), and vestibular disorders (e.g., Mal de DÃ©barquement Syndrome, MdDS).

In quantitative trading, my goal is to design computational models that empower retail and individual traders to make more informed investment decisions. This contrasts with the traditional emphasis on supporting institutional traders.
